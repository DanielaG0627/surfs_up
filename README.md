# Oahu Temperature Analysis
## Overview 

This analysis was created to provide W. Avy more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results:

The below three key differences were observed when comparing June temperature readings to those of December.

- Number of observations
    - This analysis is based on a total of 1700 tempereature observatioins for the month of June, and 1517 temeperature observations for the month of December. The measurements were taken from 9 different weather stations.

- Min, Max Average temperature
    - Minimum: June 64 Decemvber 56
    - Maximum: June 85 December 83
    - Average: June 74.94 December 71.04

    Although the minimum temperature in December is 56 degrees, the highest temperature is 83, which still makes for pleasant ice cream weather. Looking at the         minimum, maximum and average temperatures for the months of June and December, we can conclude that these two months have good surf and ice cream weather. It is not    enough data to determine good weather year-round.

- Standard Deviation 
    - The standard deviation for the temperature observations from June is 3.25 which means that 95% of the observations are between 68.44 and 81.44 degrees.
    - The standard deviation for the temperature observations from December is 3.75 which means that 95% of the observations are between 63.54 and 78.54 degrees.
    This range of temperatures provide good weather for surf and ice cream!

- Tables
    The tables below show the summary statistics for June and December temperature observations.

## Summary:
After analyzing the temperature readings for the months of June and December, it is concluded that these two months have good surf and ice cream weather. The observations are not enough to determine good surfing weather year-round. It is recommended to run the analysis for each month for a year and create a histogram of the temperature and precipitation to determine if good ice cream/surfing weather exists year-round in the island, or if alternate plans need to be made for the shop for certain months.

It is also recommended to run an inspector query on the measurements table to determine which columns are available to aid our year-round analysis.
